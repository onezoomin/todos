[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/meteor/todos/tree/react.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/meteor/todos/tree/react)

This is a Todos example app built on the principles described in the [Meteor Guide](http://guide.meteor.com/structure.html).

This fork aims to implement various UI frameworks [each on their own branch](https://github.com/onezoomin/todos/branches).

This branch (`blueprintjs`) relies on [bluprintjs](http://blueprintjs.com/)

The Origin branch (`react`) implements the UI in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html). You can read more about using React in Meteor in the [Meteor guide article on the subject](http://guide.meteor.com/v1.3/react.html).

### Running the app

```bash
meteor npm install
meteor
```
